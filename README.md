e-Feed Mart: a Python-based application program for simulating aquaculture feed transactions and market

By Harish Muhammad

## Context
Welcome to e-Feed Mart, a digital simulation program designed to mimic the interactions between fish farmers and feed agents in the aquaculture industry. This program, written in Python, caters to individuals with an interest in aquaculture and those eager to gain experience with digital skills, particularly Python programming.

### Background:
This project emerged from the desire to combine knowledge of aquaculture biology and bio-management with newly acquired Python programming skills. The program serves as a stepping stone towards developing a more comprehensive Android application, offering a cost-effective and time-efficient solution for initial testing and user feedback.

## Business Tasks
### Program Functionality:
e-Feed Mart allows users to assume the role of either a feed merchant or a fish farmer.
### Features:
**For Feed Merchants:**
•	View product list: Access and browse a comprehensive list of all available feed products, including your own and competitors' offerings.

•	Add products: Create new entries in the product list by providing details such as product code, name, manufacturer, description, stock quantity, and price.

•	Update products: Modify existing product information, including adjusting stock levels and updating prices.

•	Remove products: Delete your products from the list when necessary.

**For Fish Farmers:**
•	Browse products: Explore the complete list of feed products to compare specifications and identify suitable options.

•	Purchase products: Simulate the purchase of fish feed from the available offerings.

## Objectives:
•	Provide a realistic and efficient platform for simulating interactions between feed merchants and fish farmers within the aquaculture industry.

## Stakeholders or Target Users:
•	Fish farmers: Individuals seeking to source suitable feed products for their aquaculture needs.

•	Feed merchants: Businesses aiming to promote and sell their feed products through the program.

•	Aquaculture enthusiasts: Individuals interested in exploring and comparing various feed options for educational purposes.

•	Developers: The team responsible for building, maintaining, and enhancing the program.

•	Potential investors (if applicable): Parties interested in supporting the development of the program.

## Limitations:
•	Data management: The program uses temporary data, meaning all product information entered by users is lost upon closing the application.

•	Automatic updates: The program does not offer automatic updates for new features or information.

•	Functionality: As a simulation tool, the program has limited features compared to a more comprehensive application. Despite these limitations, E-Feed Mart allows users to gain valuable experience simulating interactions within the aquaculture feed market.

## Data Used:
•	Product code

•	Feed product name

•	Description (including nutritional values like protein, fat, and carbohydrate)

•	Stock quantity

•	Price

This data is displayed in a user-friendly list, allowing farmers and merchants to review product information. Please prepare data beforehand if you intend to simulate the role of a feed merchant.

## User Instructions:
•	To run the program, you'll need Python installed on your system.

•	Install library tabulate: pip install tabulate.

•	Follow the on-screen instructions provided by the program.

•	It is recommended to minimize typos and avoid pressing unnecessary buttons to ensure smooth operation.

**Disclaimer**: This program is intended for educational and simulation purposes only. Currently, only available in Bahasa.
